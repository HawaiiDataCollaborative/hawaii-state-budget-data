# Hawaii State Budget Data
At the Hawaii Data Collaborative, we are committed to making budget data accessible to all. This means ensuring that critical budget data is publicly available and downloadable in a usable format (i.e. data files, not pdf reports), while providing visualization tools to make meaning from that data.

The files that we have scraped into a machine-readable format are available for download here; visit our <a href="https://www.hawaiidata.org/state-budget" target="_blank">Decoding the State Budget</a> platform to view our data visualizations and access our data inventory.
