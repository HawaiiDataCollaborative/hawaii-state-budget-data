# Budget Testimonies

State contract data is typically only publicly available through individual testimony tables provided to the Hawaii State Legislature during the annual department budget informational briefings. To better understand to whom these dollars flow and for what purposes, we have extracted contract data from each briefing document into a single data file. Currently, only the active contracts tables as of December 2020 are available. To view additional tables and years, click here to find a listing of links to budget testimonies by department.
